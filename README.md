## Features

- Interactive visual circuit design interface
- Component library with logic gates, arithmetic operations, filters, and more
- Real-time circuit simulation
- Support for different data types (Binary, Integer, Float)
- Connection tracing with collision detection
- Circuit state monitoring and visualization
- Save/load circuit designs
- Integrated debug terminal

## Components

### CircuitView
The main visual interface for creating and editing circuits. Provides a grid-based layout where function blocks can be placed and connected.

### Function Blocks
Pre-defined logical components that can be added to circuits:
- **Logic Library**: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, Edge detection, RS Flip-Flops
- **Math Library**: ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, Integration, Rate of change, Filters
- **Conditional Library**: Select, Multiplexer, Compare operations
- **Timer Library**: Delay on/off, Pulse generators

### Virtual Controller
A simulation engine that executes the circuit logic. Manages data blocks, tasks, and function calls.

### Terminal
Debug interface for inspecting system state, data blocks, function execution, and circuit configuration.

## Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture:

- **State Management**: Handles the logical state of circuits and blocks
- **View Layer**: Manages the visual representation and user interaction
- **Controller**: Simulates the execution of circuits
- **Data Flow**: Manages how signals propagate between components

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with ES6+ support
- Local web server for development (optional)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/visual-circuit-designer.git
cd visual-circuit-designer
```

2. If using npm, install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start a development server or open the index.html file in your browser

## Usage

### Creating a Circuit

1. Use the menu bar to add function blocks from the available libraries
2. Position blocks by dragging them on the grid
3. Connect block inputs and outputs by dragging from one pin to another
4. Configure block properties through the context menu (right-click)
5. Run the simulation using the controller buttons

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Delete/Backspace**: Remove selected elements
- **Shift + Click**: Multiple selection
- **Right-click**: Context menu
- **Middle Mouse/Alt + Drag**: Pan view

## Development

The project is built with TypeScript and uses a modular component architecture. Key development aspects:

- **GUI Layer**: Built on custom components for optimized rendering
- **Circuit Grid**: Manages collision detection and connection routing
- **Event System**: Handles user interactions and updates
- **Vector Library**: Simplifies position and size calculations
